# Firebase example

This example gives you two routes and an application-wide layout. It's built using create-react-app.

In this example, there's no static rendering. Instead, the `<App />` component in `App.tsx` handles all your routing, using the routes defined in `routes/index.js`.

You will need to set the Firebase environment variables defined in `config.ts`.

```
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start the dev server
yarn start

# Build the production version
yarn build
```
