# Basic Example

This example gives you two routes and an application-wide layout. It's built using create-react-app.

In this example, there's no static rendering. Instead, the `<Navigation />` component in `index.js` handles all your routing, using the routes defined in `routes/index.js`.

To try it, change into this directory, install the dependencies, and then start the dev server or build the production version:

```
cd basic

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm start

# Build the production version
npm run build
```
