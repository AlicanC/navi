# Basic Example

This example just gives you static rendering and two pages.

To try it, change into this directory, install the dependencies, and then start the dev server or build the production version:

```
cd basic

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm start

# Build the production version
npm run build
```
