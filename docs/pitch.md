- composable routing
- allows 1:many *and* many:1 routes
- route matching is part of your model/controller -- not your view
- don't bikeshed about URLs
- fast enough to create <Link> elements within virtualized grids (need demo)


Yo Dawg, I heard you like Routes. So I defined your Routes with Routes, so you can get Routes from your Routes

Would we even need routes if there were no junctions?
