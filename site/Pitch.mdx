# Junctions

Add routes to your reusable components

<Link theme={<ButtonView />}>15 Minute Course</Link>
<Link theme={<ButtonView />}>Documentation</Link>

## The Gist

<Tab.Group theme={<TabbedExamplesView />}>
  <Tab.Item title='Vanilla React'>
      <ComponentExample example={GistVanillaExample} />
  </Tab.Item>
  <Tab.Item title='Sugar Free'>
      <ComponentExample example={GistSugarFreeExample} />
  </Tab.Item>
</Tab.Group>

## Try For Yourself

Create a new React app:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app junctions-example
cd junctions-example
```

Install junctions:

```bash
npm install --save junctions react-junctions history
```

Then copy and paste any example from this page into your `src/App.js` file! For example, this one:

<ComponentExample example={BasicExample} />

## What about react-router 4?

The main difference between junctions.js and react-router is this: **junctions puts components first, react-router puts URLs first**.

This means that if you're building an application, junctions will probably solve your problem better. And while some people are still building websites, most people are building applications.

But let's look at some specifics.

### Junctions makes routing information more accessible

- In **junctions.js**, your routes are defined in a `createJunction()` statement, and accessible through your component's `junctions` property.
- In **react-router 4**, your routes are defined within your component's `render()` method using `<Route>` elements, and hidden from the outside world.

Junctions is a little bit more verbose, but it gives you a lot more flexibility. You can use the `Junction` object that it provides to generate things like menus or a list of all possible routes:

<Tab.Group theme={<TabbedExamplesView />}>
  <Tab.Item title='Menu'>
      <ComponentExample example={MenuExample} />
  </Tab.Item>
  <Tab.Item title='Route Map'>
      <ComponentExample example={RouteMapExample} />
  </Tab.Item>
</Tab.Group>

### Junctions warns you when a linked path does not exist

Because routing information is accessible to the outside world, the junctions.js `<Link>` element will warn you when you've made a typo or referred to a non-existent route.
