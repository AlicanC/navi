Quick Start
-----------

Get started with [Create React/Navi App](https://frontarm.com/navi/create-react-navi-app/):

```bash
npx create-react-navi-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Navi also works great as a standalone router for your React app. Just add the `navi` and `react-navi` packages to your project:

```bash
npm install --save navi react-navi
```


The minimal example
-------------------

*You can view [this example with live editors](https://frontarm.com/navi/guides/minimal-example/) on the documentation website.*

After spinning up a fresh app with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and installing `navi` and `react-navi`, there are just three steps to getting a basic app running:

### 1. Declare some pages

To declare your pages, you'll use Navi's `createSwitch()` and `createPage()` functions. Switches are used to map paths to pages. Pages represent individual locations that you can navigate to.

```js
// pages/index.js
import { createPage, createSwitch } from 'navi'
import * as React from 'react'
import { NavLink } from 'react-navi'

export default createSwitch({
  paths: {
    '/': createPage({
      title: "Navi",
      content:
        <div>
          <h2>Navi</h2>
          <p>A router/loader for React</p>
          <nav><NavLink href='/reference'>API Reference</NavLink></nav>
        </div>
    }),

    '/reference': createPage({
      title: "API Reference",
      getContent: () => import('./reference.js')
    }),
  }
})
```

As you'll see later, your content can be *anything*. You can return markdown, JSON, or even arbitrary functions! But `react-navi` has special support for React elements and components, so let's start by defining the content that way.

But what about the `/reference` page? It's not returning an element or component. It's returning a *Promise* to a component -- and this is where Navi shines. When the user clicks the "API reference" link, instead of immediately rendering a blank page, Navi will wait until `reference.js` has loaded ---  and *then* it'll render the page.

```js
// pages/reference.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { NavLink } from 'react-navi'

export default function Reference() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Reference</h2>
      <p>Coming soon.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Create a `Navigation` object

Navi does all of the hard work within a `Navigation` object. This is where Navi watches for history events, matches URLs to pages and content, and turns all this info into an object that you can use.

To create a `Navigation`, just call `createBrowserNavigation()` within `index.js`, passing in the `pages` object that you defined earlier. Once you have a `Navigation`, wait for the content to be ready -- and then just render it!

```js
// index.js
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { createBrowserNavigation } from 'navi'
import pages from './pages'
import App from './App'

async function main() {
  let navigation = createBrowserNavigation({ pages })

  // Wait until async content is ready, or has failed.
  await navigation.steady()

  ReactDOM.render(
    <App navigation={navigation} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

// Start the app
main()
```


### 3. Render the content within `<App>`

The `navigation` object that you just passed to `<App>` contains all of the information that you need to render your app. And while you *could* consume all of that information yourself, it's far simpler to just use Navi's built in components.

To start out, you'll only need two components: `<NavProvider>`, and `<NavContent>`. You'll want to wrap `<NavProvider>` around your entire App, and then place `<NavContent>` wherever the content should go.

```js
// App.js
import * as React from 'react'
import { NavLink, NavProvider, NavContent } from 'react-navi'
import './App.css'

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <div className="App">
          <header className="App-header">
            <h1 className="App-title">
              <NavLink href='/'>Navi</NavLink>
            </h1>
          </header>
          <NavContent />
        </div>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

And that's it --- you've built a working app with asynchronous routes! Of course, this tiny app is just an example, but Navi handles real-world apps with ease. In fact, [Frontend Armory](https://frontarm.com) is built with Navi.

To finish off, let's add a couple real-world tweaks as a bonus step, just to see how easy it can be.


### Loading indicators

As Navi doesn't render the new page until it has loaded, there can sometimes be a large delay between clicking a link seeing the result. In cases like this, it's important to keep the user in the loop. And to do so, you can wrap your route with a `<NavLoading>` component:

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {loadingRoute =>
            <div className="App">
              {
                loadingRoute &&
                <div className="App-loading-bar" />
              }
              <header className="App-header">
                <h1 className="App-title">
                  <NavLink href='/'>Navi</NavLink>
                </h1>
              </header>
              <NavContent />
            </div>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}
```

The `<NavLoading>` component accepts a render function as its children, to which it passes any route whose content is still being fetched, or `undefined` if the curent URL has fully loaded. You can use this to show a loading bar or some other indicator.


### Handling 404s

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <NavProvider navigation={this.props.navigation}>
        <NavLoading>
          {loadingRoute =>
            <div className="App">
              {
                loadingRoute &&
                <div className="App-loading-bar" />
              }
              <header className="App-header">
                <h1 className="App-title">
                  <NavLink href='/'>Navi</NavLink>
                </h1>
              </header>
              <NavNotFoundBoundary render={renderNotFound}>
                <NavContent />
              </NavNotFoundBoundary>
            </div>
          }
        </NavLoading>
      </NavProvider>
    );
  }
}

function renderNotFound() {
  return (
    <div className='App-error'>
      <h1>404 - Not Found</h1>
    </div>
  )
} 
```
