# Welcome to your new React/Navi based website!

This project was bootstrapped with [**Create React Site**](https://github.com/frontarm/create-react-site).

**Create React Site** is an extension to [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started), with the following features:

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files can be imported, allowing you write your site's contents with a mix of Markdown and JSX.
- The initial template includes the [Navi](https://frontarm.com/navi/) router, with two example pages included in the `src/pages` directory.
- The `npm run build` script has been extended to [statically render](https://frontarm.com/articles/static-vs-server-rendering/) for each page, improving SEO and SMO.

Othewise, create-react-site is identical to create-react-app!
